# Vampire Survivor in Python 

This is my first ever game made in Python. I followed the youtube tutorial of [@CearCode](https://www.youtube.com/@ClearCode).  
Link to the video :arrow_right: *<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OMghdHP-zs>*

The goal was to familiarized myself with python since I was, mostly, from a javascript and typescript background.

This is a topdown 2D shooter where the player moves with keys and shoot with the mouse and eemies are randomly generated.

Enjoy ! :grin:
